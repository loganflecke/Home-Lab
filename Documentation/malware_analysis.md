# Malware Analysis  

## Flare VM  

Flare VM is my Windows malware analysis environment. Itâ€™s packed with tools for both static and dynamic analysis, set up using the instructions in my [Medium article](https://medium.com/@logan.flecke/installing-the-flare-vm-for-malware-analysis-36a4a302ca41).  

### Tools  

Some key tools I use:  
- **IDA Free** / **Ghidra**: Reverse engineering.  
- **x64dbg**: Debugging.  
- **CyberChef**: Decoding and deobfuscation.  
- **Capa**: Static analysis for malicious capabilities.  
- **PE Studio**: Inspecting PE files.  
- **Wireshark**: Analyzing network traffic.  

### Where to Find Malware  

I plan to pull malware samples from public repositories like MalwareBazaar, Hybrid Analysis, or similar trusted sources.  

### Transporting Malware  

Still figuring this out. Likely password-protected `.zip` files for safety, moved securely to the Flare VM via a temporary RDP connection.
