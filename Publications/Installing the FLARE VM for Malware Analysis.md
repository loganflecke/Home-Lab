## **Step 1: Preparing the Environment**  

### **1.1 Create a New Virtual Machine**  
- Install Windows 10 or 11 on your virtualization platform.  
- Install VMware Tools or VirtualBox Guest Additions for enhanced VM performance.  

### **1.2 Disable Antivirus and Windows Defender**  
- Open Windows Security.  
- Navigate to `Virus & Threat Protection > Manage Settings`.  
- Turn off real-time protection and tamper protection.

## **Step 3: Post-Installation Configuration**  

### **3.1 Verify Installation**  
- Open the FLARE VM desktop environment.  
- Check for tools like IDA Free, Ghidra, and dnSpy.  

### **3.2 Take a Snapshot**  
- Save the current state of the VM for easy rollback.  

### **3.3 Network Isolation**  
- Disconnect the VM from the internet to prevent malware from exfiltrating data.  
- Use a virtual network with no outbound access for safer analysis.

## **Best Practices for Malware Analysis**  

1. **Use Snapshots Frequently**  
   - Roll back to a clean state after each analysis.  

2. **Monitor Network Activity**  
   - Analyze malicious network behavior using tools like Wireshark or Security Onion.  

3. **Document Findings**  
   - Keep detailed notes on observed behavior for future reference.
